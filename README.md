# Determination of material dependent parameters and friction in ultrasonic vibration-assisted turning by inverse modelling

## Abstract
In this work, the normal and friction forces in ultrasonic-vibration assisted turning are estimated
using an inverse method to evaluate the material parameters and friction. The inverse method
requires the measurement of normal force, friction force and tool-chip contact length in
conventional turning. The analytical expressions are used to estimate the normal and frictions.
The inverse model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results
available in the literature. The proposed methodology can be used for online determination of
material dependent parameters and friction in ultrasonic-vibration assisted turning.
